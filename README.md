# JunketBlog - Travelers Lifestyle. üó∫Ô∏è 

## Welcome to JunketBlog 
JunketBlog is a blog web app developed using the Django framework and other modern technologies. It forms a crucial part of my Portfolio Project 4 for Code Institute.
With that said..... let me tell you the story! ‚¨áÔ∏è

## The story
The concept for this app initially started as a school project but soon took on personal meaning for me. I envisioned it as a space where my sister and mother could document and share their travel experiences. However, partway through the development and study process, my family experienced a significant tragedy that profoundly affected me. The emotional toll impacted my focus on this project and my studies overall, leading to delays and an extension for the submission deadline.

Before diving into the technical aspects, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Kieron and the team at Code Institute for their unwavering support during this challenging time.

Throughout these difficult months, I've learned a great deal - not only about coding but also about resilience and perseverance. While I regret that this submission doesn't reflect the level of engagement I had originally intended, it still represents the skills and dedication I've built over the past year.

## Transparency and Future Improvements
I am fully aware that certain aspects of this project are incomplete or not fully polished. Specifically:

* Automated Test Cases:  I was unable to implement robust automated testing in this iteration of the project. However, I manually tested all functions to ensure they work correctly, and the current version of the web app reflects those tests.
While I made efforts toward code quality, I recognize that my project does not fully comply with WC3 standards and PEP8 guidelines, which will be addressed in future updates. I have showcased compliance through screenshots of my largest Python files, but these changes have not been implemented yet to maintain a working app. This decision was made to avoid last-minute deployment issues while still showcasing the functionality of the application.
* General Engagement: Due to personal circumstances, my level of involvement in this project was impacted, and I wasn't able to deliver the engagement and depth I had originally planned.
That said, I plan to address these shortcomings and continue improving JunketBlog. My goal is to further develop this project, implementing the necessary improvements to make it a more robust and polished application.
* User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX): The current UI and UX are not aligned with the level of design and usability I originally envisioned for the project. I plan to improve the visual design and overall user experience in future iterations.

## Agile Methodology

For this project, the Agile methodology was intended to guide development. GitHub and its Project Board were used to organize user stories and manage workflow. However, due to given circumstances and as a solo developer working on this project, I found myself focusing more on completing tasks within the given timeframe. User stories were initially created and directly added to the 'Done' column rather than progressively moving through 'To Do' and 'In Progress', as is typical in Agile workflows. I have also added the stories I would like to implement in the future to the 'Not Done' column.

While this approach deviated from a traditional Agile process, using user stories still helped ensure that key features were completed. I acknowledge that Agile methodology is particularly beneficial in a team setting, where collaboration and iterative feedback are essential. In future projects especially when working in a development team, I plan to adopt a more structured Agile approach with iterative development, regular testing, and proper backlog management to allow for greater flexibility and continuous improvement.

* Next, scroll down to the Buildpack section, click `Add Buildpack` select python and click Save Changes.

## Set up Environment Variables
* In you IDE create a new env.py file in the top level directory.
* Add env.py to the .gitignore file.
* In env.py import the os library.
* In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste the link copied from Heroku DATABASE_URL".
* In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own random secret key"`.
* In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same `SECRET_KEY` created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

## Setting up settings.py
* In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

 ```
 from pathlib import Path
 import os
 import dj_database_url

 if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
  import env
 ```
* Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)`
* Comment out the `DATABASES` section in settings.py and replace with:
```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }`
```
* Create a Cloudinary account and from the 'Dashboard' in Cloudinary copy your url into the env.py file by typing: `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<insert-your-url>"`
* In Heroku, click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with the `CLOUDINARY_URL`
* Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
 ```
 'cloudinary_storage'
 'django.contrib.staticfiles''
 'cloudinary'
 ```
* Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in `settings.py`:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
* Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: 
```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<Heroku_app_name>.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```
* Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following:
    ``` web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi ```

* Commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository.

## Heroku Deployment 
* Click Deploy tab in Heroku.
* Select Github as the deployment method.
* Confirm you want to connect to GitHub.
* Search for the repository name and click the connect button to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.
* Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type.
* Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github or To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.

## Final Deployment

* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py` 
* In Heroku settings config vars change the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` value to 0
* Because DEBUG must be switched to True for development and False for production it is recommended that only manual deployment is used in Heroku. 
* To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.

## Acknowledgements

I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to **Code Institute** and especially **Kieron** for his unwavering support during what has been a challenging period in my life. His understanding and approval for an extension, given my personal circumstances and the tragic events my family faced, have been truly invaluable.

Although I couldn't fully utilize the extra time and find myself feeling a bit disappointed that this submission doesn't reflect my true potential, I recognize the immense knowledge and skills I‚Äôve gained throughout this wonderful year with CI. My goal is to submit what I have now and await the assessment so I can roll up my sleeves and polish this app into something I can be proud of. I'm excited about the journey ahead and eager to bring this project to its true potential!
